# Simple Jump To Nav

This example isolates the responsive jump-to navigation pattern we built for the Arc header. Everything is rendered using Helvetica, black-and-white colors, and simplified markup.

- The nav sticks at the top and keeps links evenly spaced.
- Clicking a link scrolls smoothly to each section.
- Plenty of whitespace separates the sections for clarity.

Open `index.html` to try it out in a browser.
